# Eclipse Tractus-X quality checks

The [Eclipse Tractus-X](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/automotive.tractusx) quality checks is an automation effort
to ensure basic quality alignment across [Tractus-X OSS products](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/).

The checks will be aligned with the [Tractus-X release guidelines](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs/release) and
are available as library to use in multiple usecases. These could be:

- PR checks to test, if contributions follow release guidelines
- Dashboards to show overall alignment of products
- Binaries to check code locally (manual run, pre-commit hooks, ...)
- ...
